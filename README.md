The project name is Add Task, or assign the work to employees.
This project has been implemented by the Django framework and the sqlite3 database, which add tasks. 
There're three modules implementing that: Login, Register, and Add Task.
In this Register:- There is a registered user using his personal details 
like Name, Email, Password, Address.
When you enter your address, you will obtain a latitude and longitude by using Google Maps,
which uses the Google API. In this code, I do not mention an API key because it is confidential.Â
